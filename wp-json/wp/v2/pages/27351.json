Her curiosity later led her to travel to Hong Kong, where she spent six months as an exchange student. Upon returning from her travels and studies, she joined Second Grade as the lead teacher for English and Mathematics. Later, she became interested in leading STEAM projects in the Elementary section, working on projects with students from Second to Fifth grade.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">She then pursued a Master&#8217;s degree in Education at High Tech High in San Diego, California, specializing in Project-based Learning. High Tech High is internationally recognized for training educators in the creation and development of projects with students. During her time there, she worked with schools and students in grades 3, 4, 5, and 8. She also received training to complete her master&#8217;s degree in one year and return to Colombia.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In August 2023, she will be working at the Innovation Center, aiming to put into practice everything she has learned throughout these years of training and personal growth. She is thrilled to be working at the Innovation Center and to provide students and teachers with a quality education that prepares them for the challenges of the world. She aims to provide rich learning experiences that students enjoy and where they can put their talents at the service of the community.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Through innovation, the goal is to enhance children&#8217;s learning by always striving for relevance (making it meaningful for them) and rigor (deep learning that encourages critical thinking, questioning, and development of their critical abilities). She firmly believes that education is the most powerful tool to change the lives of our students and teachers.

Finding balance is difficult and is something we should always look for. Never be afraid to ask.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">THE PASSION: Nothing that you propose to do, you will achieve or maintain in time if you do not do something that you are passionate about. Something that will take away your sleep at night or motivate you to stop going out on a weekend to dedicate time to focus on your goal. Do not come short in effort and do everything with the outmost desire. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BELIEVE IN ONESELF: When you think you know something, believe in it. Always SUPPORT your opinions with arguments and question everything. But when you get to know something that you believe and that you are passionate about, stay with that idea. The world we found outside was created by people not exactly smarter than you.

The English classes at College, where she read books by great authors of English-speaking literature, allowed her to excel successfully in a postgraduate complex of creative writing in English at the University of Manchester. She met in those classes, great authors such as Capote and Paul Auster, who influenced her writing skills. Mar\u00eda Alejandra graduated from History at the Universidad de los Andes with an emphasis in Journalism and Literature. She has taken courses in creative literature at the University of New York, NYU, and an MA in creative writing at the University of Manchester. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among her achievements is having successfully completed a master&#8217;s degree in English in creative writing and being the co-editor of the book &#8220;The Manchester Anthology&#8221; which brings together the texts of 16 authors of fiction and poetry in Manchester. When the program&#8217;s directors admitted her to the program, they did not expect success, since they had never admitted a writer whose native language was Spanish and not English. However, her persistence and ability to work, without forgetting English proficiency, has allowed her to graduate with great recognitions. She has made many readings of her produced texts in literary events and in the launch of the book she co-edited. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She is currently completing her first novel. For this 24-year-old former student, the word success is synonym of persistence. She says that we must first define what makes us happy and have the strength to work and be closer to fulfilling our purposes every day.<\/span><\/p>\n[\/et_pb_accordion_item][\/et_pb_accordion][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;1_5,3_5,1_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;3_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_code _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; module_alignment=&#8221;center&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/embed\/episode\/1OLduEtInZHho3lUrXZ71b\/video?utm_source=generator\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" frameBorder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"><\/iframe>[\/et_pb_code][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;1_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;||1px|||&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_code _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;||0px|||&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][rev_slider alias=&#8221;alumni&#8221;][\/et_pb_code][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WELCOME HOMEAt Altamira, we&#8217;re committed to creating lifelong relationships with our talented students, even when life takes us in different directions.
